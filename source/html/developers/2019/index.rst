Development Plans for 2019
**************************

These are the plans for the development of SEAMM in the last half
of 2019.

Goals
_____
The overall goals for SEAMM are

#. Create an easy-to-use productivity environment for users of
   computational molecular and materials codes (CMS), with a wide
   range of tools for building, simulation and analysis of molecular,
   fluid and crystalline materials.
#. Provide developers an easy-to-use, well-defined plugin framework
   for integrating their codes in the SEAMM environment so that users
   can use their code. 
#. Provide system managers and support staff an easier, more
   productive way to provide CMS functionality to end users. 

The goals for this first six-month phase of the project, starting July
2019, are

#. To establish a development process in accord with MolSSI best practices.
#. To develop enough of the SEAMM framework to be useful
#. To create sufficient plugins to run realistic, useful simulations
   with both forcefield and quantum methods.
#. To use the MOPAC validation suite case as a use case to
   improve and test  the overall functionality of SEAMM and of the
   MOPAC plugin.
#. To use the predicition of fluid properties as a use case to
   improve and test  the overall functionality of SEAMM and of the
   LAMMPS plugin.
