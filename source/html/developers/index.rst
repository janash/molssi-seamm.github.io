For Developers
**************
This subsection of the website is primarily about developing both SEAMM
and plugins for SEAMM. However, some sections such as the design of
SEAMM might be of interest even if you don't plan to pull out an
editor and get to coding.

:ref:`home_for_tools`:
----------------------
SEAMM makes it straightforward for developers and other experts to
publish their existing and new codes and scripts as plug-ins and
flowcharts, making them immediately available to the entire
community.
