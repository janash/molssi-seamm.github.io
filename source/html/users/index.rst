What is SEAMM?
--------------
SEAMM is a user-friendly environment for computational molecular and
materials science, using plug-ins to provide a wide range of building,
simulation and analysis tools. SEAMM handles the entire range of
atomic, molecular, crystalline, amorphous, and fluid systems that are
described at the level of atoms and electrons.  SEAMM provides three
important capabilities:

* :ref:`productivity`: The computational tools are wrapped with plug-ins that
  adapt them to SEAMM and provide graphical interfaces (GUIs) that help
  you set up calculations without editing complex input files and
  structures by hand.
* :ref:`reproducibility`: Computational protocols are
  captured as shareable graphical flowcharts. You can create your own,
  or start with ones created by experts in a particular domain, tweaking
  them to fit your problem.
