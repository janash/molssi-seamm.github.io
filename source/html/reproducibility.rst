Reproducibility and Replicability
*********************************

The Productivity_ section mentioned that the flowcharts are reusable
and shareable. Let's look into that a bit more, because it is a much
more powerful feature than is perhaps obvious at first glance. But
before that, lets define some terms, because there is a lot of
confusion in the literature and common usage. We will follow the
NAtional Academies of Sciences report `Reproducibility and
Replicability in Science`_

Reproducibility
   is obtaining consistent results using the same input data,
   computational steps, methods, and code, and conditions of
   analysis. This definition is synonymous with “computational
   reproducibility”.

Replicability
   is obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering
   the same scientific question, each of which has obtained its own
   data. Two studies may be considered to have replicated if they
   obtain consistent results given the level of uncertainty inherent
   in the system under study.

Generalizability
  another term frequently used in science, refers to the extent that
  results of a study apply in other contexts or populations that
  differ from the original one.
