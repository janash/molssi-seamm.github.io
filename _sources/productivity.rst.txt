SEAMM helps you get your work done faster and more easilty. First, it
helps you set up your calculations. The large simulation codes are
wrapped in plug-ins which provide intuitive graphical user interfaces
(GUIs) so you don't have to start with an empty input file in a text
editor and remeber all the keywords and commands for each code. While
you maybe very comfortable with one or two codes, you probably can use
other codes in your research, but don't know their input as
well. SEAMM supports a wide range of codes, such as

* MOPAC for semiempirical quantum chemistry
* GAMESS, NWChem and Psi4 for quantum cehmistry
* VASP, Quantum Espresso, FHI*aims and NWChem for periodic DFT
* GROMACS, NAMD, etc. for biomolecular molecular dynamics (MD)
* LAMMPS for molecular dynamics (MD) for materials
* Cassandra and Towhee for Monte Carlo simulations of fluids

Other plugins provide functionality for building structures,
e.g. Packmol, for converting file formats using Open Babel, and
cheminformatics functionality in RDKit.

Of course, at the moment SEAMM is just getting started and only has
functionality from MOPAC, LAMMPS, Open Babel, Packmol and RDKit, but
is built to cover the wide range of molecular and material modeling
illustrated by the codes above.
