The Dashboard is the other part of SEAMM that you will interact with
in addition to the :ref:`graphical user interface`. The Dashboard is
the web portal into the :term:`jobs<job>` in the :term:`Job
Datastore`, and also has information from the :term:`Job Manager` on
jobs that are submitted but not yet completed.
