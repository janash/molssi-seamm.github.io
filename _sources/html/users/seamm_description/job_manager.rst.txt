Job Manager

The Job Manager is another part of SEAMM that you won't see directly,
though the :term:`Dashboard` lets you see the running jobs, which are
managed by the Job Manager. It hides the complexity of running jobs
all the different machines you may be using, organizing the jobs, get
the data to run them to the right machine, submitting tasks to queues,
and getting the results back. Lots of boring detail which is much
better done by the computer than by you!
