Flowchart Interpreter
*********************

A :term:`flowchart` is a set of instructions for how to carry out a
simulation protocol. In the middle of SEAMM is an intepreter that
reads the language of a flowchart and turns it into instructions for
what to do, which programs to run, what data to collect and all the
other things that you request in your flowchart. You'll never actually
see the interpreter itself, but it is there, telling the computer to
do what you want it do.
