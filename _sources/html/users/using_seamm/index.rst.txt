****************************
How do you run a simulation?
****************************

You create a :term:`flowchart`, like this:

.. image:: /images/flowchart.png
	    :align: center
	    :alt: An example flowchart

that defines the :term:`steps<step>` you want in your simulation. Once
you are satisfied with it, there are a number ways to run it ... but
first, some more detail in running the SEAMM GUI and creating
flowcharts.

Starting the SEAMM GUI
**********************

Activate the seamm conda environment that you installed_::

  conda activate seamm

Then run **seamm** from the command prompt::

  (seamm) pwsmac:~ psaxe$ seamm

In a few seconds a window like this should appear:

.. image:: /images/seamm.png
	    :align: center
	    :alt: The SEAMM window
