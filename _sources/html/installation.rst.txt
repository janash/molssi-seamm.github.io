Installing SEAMM
****************

The graphical part of SEAMM is installed in the **seamm** conda
environment. If you do not have conda (or anaconda) installed, head
over to Miniconda_ or Anaconda_ and grab the installer, following
their directions. Miniconda_ is a small, stripped down version, which
is perfectly fine for our use. Anaconda_ comes with many packages
preinstalled and also a graphical interface, so if you plan to use it
for your own work it might be more useful. But Anaconda_ is more than
is needed for SEAMM.

Once you have conda installed, get the `seamm.yml`_ file from the
`conda_environments/`_ subfolder of the `molssi-seamm/misc`_ GitHub
project. You can download it from GitHub (right-click here_ and select
download) or just clone this entire repository. Either way, once you
have it run the conda command to create the environment::

  conda env create -f seamm.yml

If you prefer a name other than the default of **seamm** for the
environment, add that name like this::

  conda env create -f seamm.yml -n <name>

Once the environment is installed, activate it with::

  conda activate seamm

If you chose a different name, use that instead of **seamm**.

You can start the flowchart editor by typing::

  seamm

There are some sample flowcharts in `misc/flowcharts`_ to help you get
started.

Installing the Compute Engines
------------------------------
**N.B. Currently only Linux and MacOS versions of Packmol and LAMMPS
are supported by conda-forge. So, at the moment, these instructions
will not work under Windows.**

The plugins in SEAMM use a number of external executables to accomplish
their tasks.

   - **seamm_util** and **from_smiles_step** use parts of OpenBabel
   - **packmol_step** uses Packmol to build fluid systems
   - **lammps_step** uses LAMMPS and OpenMPI
   - **mopac_step** uses MOPAC

Installing LAMMPS, OpenBabel and Packmol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you want to run flowcharts using these plugins, you will need to
install the correct executables. All of these except MOPAC can be
installed using the conda environment specified in
`seamm-compute.yml`_ (right-click to download_)::

  conda env create -f seamm-compute.yml
  
Of course, if you want a name other than the default **seamm-compute**
you can override the default with the -n option.

Installing MOPAC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Head to the MOPAC_ homepage and click on one of the download links in
the section on MOPAC2016. MOPAC is free for academics, so if you are
at a university or school you can request a copy and license. Follow
the instructions included with the download for installing MOPAC and
activating MOPAC.

The path to the MOPAC executable is stored in the next step in the
file ~/.seamm/mopac.ini. If MOPAC is not in your path you can have the
script create the file, then edit ~/.seamm/mopac.ini to put in the
correct path -- usually /opt/mopac/MOPAC2016.exe on Linux or Windows.

Finishing Up
~~~~~~~~~~~~
After the installation completes, activate the environment::

  conda activate seamm-compute

There is one more step needed to let SEAMM know the location of the
executables. Execute the script `find_executables.py`_ (`right-click
to download`_) in the **seamm-compute** environment::

  ./find_executables.py

The script may ask you some questions, but normally it will just run
to completion, telling you that it created *~/.seamm/packmol.ini*,
*~/.seamm/openbabel.ini* and *~/.seamm/lammps.ini*. The hidden
directory *~/.seamm* is where SEAMM expects to find configuration
files.
