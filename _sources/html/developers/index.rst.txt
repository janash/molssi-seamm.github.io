For Developers
**************
This subsection of the website is primarily about developing both SEAMM
and plugins for SEAMM. However, some sections such as the design of
SEAMM might be of interest even if you don't plan to pull out an
editor and get to coding.

* Design_ documents the design of SEAMM from top to bottom.
* `Developer documentation`_ provides an overview for how to work with
  SEAMM.
* Plans_ are the historical and current development plans for SEAMM.
