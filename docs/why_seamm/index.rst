Why SEAMM?
**********

Researchers in computational molecular sciences and its subdomains are usually
familiar with a (possibly long) list of software packages that are
pertinent to their field of study. Here, we plan to clarify why researchers
should consider using SEAMM instead of using a selected list of softwares,
each focusing on solving one or multiple specific problems. We believe our
open-source software offers a user-friendly and interoperable ecosystem with
features that make the research workflows more convenient, efficient and
reproducible. SEAMM distinguishes itself from other atomistic simulation
software packages because it should not be considered as a competitor to the
existing simulation engines. On the contrary, SEAMM offers an interoperable
environment that brings all these simulation software packages together in
order to improve :ref:`productivity <productivity>` and remove the need for
installing multiple software and managing their dependencies. Above all, SEAMM
hides all software-specific complexities such as code syntaxes and input keywords
behind a unified and user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) in order to
improve the :ref:`user experience <user-experience>` through exposing the main
functionalities of the simulation engines all in the same place. By offering
:term:`plug-ins <plug-in>` and :term:`flowcharts <flowchart>`, SEAMM removes the
need for manual scripting to promote :ref:`workflow features <workflow-features>`
such as reproducibility, replicability, generalizability and reusability.

The realization of the aforementioned features in SEAMM became possible by
focusing on three major aspects of the atomistic simulation software development

1. :ref:`user-experience`
#. :ref:`productivity`
#. :ref:`workflow-features`

SEAMM developers believe the users of the atomistic simulation software packages
should be able to spend their time in scientific research and discovery instead
of wasting it in learning different program-specific keywords and syntaxes or
resolving software-related issues. If you user who has dealt with these issues,
we invite you to :ref:`install <installation>` our software and give it a try!
It is easy and convenient and we have prepared/are preparing many
:ref:`tutorials <tutorials>` to help you find your path in this journey. Let us
know what you think about SEAMM. We look forward to hearing from you about your
experience and feedback.
