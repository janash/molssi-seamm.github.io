Why SEAMM?
**********

Researchers in computational molecular sciences and its subdomains are usually
familiar with a (possibly long) list of software packages that are
pertinent to their field of study. Here, we plan to clarify why should
researchers should consider using SEAMM instead of using a selected list
of softwares each solving one or multiple specific problems? We believe our
open-source software offers a user-friendly interoperable ecosystem with features
that make your research workflow convenient, efficient and fully reproducible.
SEAMM distinguishes itself from other atomistic simulation software packages
because it should not be considered as a competitor to the existing simulation
engines. On the contrary, SEAMM offers an interoperable environment that can
bring all these simulation software packages together to improve
:ref:`productivity <productivity>` and remove the need from the users to install
each software and manage their dependencies. Above all, SEAMM hides all
software-specific complexities such as syntaxes and input keywords behind a
unified and user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) in order to improve
the :ref:`user experience <user-experience>` by exposing the main functionalities
of the simulation engines all in the same place. Through offering
:term:`plug-ins <plug-in>` and :term:`flowcharts <flowchart>`, SEAMM removes the
need for manual scripting to promote :ref:`workflow features <workflow-features>`
such as full reproducibility and reusability.

The aforementioned features in SEAMM have been realized through focusing on
three major aspects in the atomistic simulation software development

1. :ref:`user-experience`
#. :ref:`productivity`
#. :ref:`workflow-features`
