Job Manager
***********

The Job Manager is another part of SEAMM that you won't see directly,
though the :term:`dashboard` lets you see the running
:term:`jobs<job>`, which are managed by the Job Manager. It hides the
complexity of running jobs all the different machines you may be
using, organizing the jobs, get the data to run them to the right
machine, submitting :term:`tasks<task>` to queues, and getting the
results back. Lots of boring detail which is much better done by the
computer than by you!
