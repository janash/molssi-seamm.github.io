Background Information
**********************

This part of the documentation will help you understand how SEAMM does things. Every
code has a philosophy underlying how you interact with it. Usually this is not written
down. You have to learn by trial and error. Here we try to write down how and why SEAMM
acts as it does. Hopefully this will give you a better feel for what will and won't
work, and how to approach your research using SEAMM.
