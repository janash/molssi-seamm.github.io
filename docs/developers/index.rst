Developers Documentation
************************
This subsection of the website is primarily about developing both
SEAMM and :term:`plug-ins<plug-in>` for SEAMM. However, some sections
such as the design of SEAMM might be of interest even if you don't
plan to pull out an editor and get to coding.

:ref:`home_for_tools`:
----------------------
SEAMM makes it straightforward for developers and other experts to
publish their existing and new codes and scripts as plug-ins and
:term:`flowcharts<flowchart>`, making them immediately available to
the entire community.
