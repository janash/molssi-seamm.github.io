## What is SEAMM?
SEAMM is a computational environment for creating and running
simulations of molecular, crystalline, amorphous or fluid systems
that are described at the level of atoms. While SEAMM provides the
overall environment, plugins provide specific functionality. While
some plugins handle their task internally, many are wrappers about
well-known, widely used simulation tools such as:
- MOPAC for semiempirical quantum chemistry
- GAMESS, NWChem and Psi4 for quantum cehmistry
- VASP, Quantum Espresso, FHI-aims and NWChem for periodic DFT
- GROMACS, NAMD, etc. for biomolecular molecular dynamics (MD)
- LAMMPS for molecular dynamics (MD) for materials
- Cassandra and Towhee for Monte Carlo simulations of fluids

Other plugins provide functionality for building structures,
e.g. Packmol, for converting file formats using Open Babel, and
cheminformatics functionality in RDKit.

Of course, at the moment SEAMM is just getting started and only has
functionality from MOPAC, LAMMPS, Open Babel, Packmol and RDKit, but
is built to cover the wide range of molecular and material modeling
illustrated by the codes above.

### How do you run a simulation?
You create a flowchart, like this:
<p align="center">
  <img src="_images/flowchart.png" width="906" height="731" title="A flowchart">
</p>

that defines the steps you want in your simulation. Once you are
satisfied with it, there are a number ways to run it ... but we are
getting ahead of ourselves!

See the menu for the details about installing SEAMM, making
flowcharts, and running.
