What is SEAMM?
**************
SEAMM is a user-friendly environment for computational molecular and
materials science, using plug-ins to provide a wide range of building,
simulation and analysis tools. SEAMM handles the entire range of
atomic, molecular, crystalline, amorphous, and fluid systems that are
described at the level of atoms and electrons.  SEAMM provides three
important capabilities:

* Productivity_: The computational tools are wrapped with plug-ins that
  adapt them to SEAMM and provide graphical interfaces (GUIs) that help
  you set up calculations without editing complex input files and
  structures by hand.
* Reproducibility and replicability: Computational protocols are
  captured as shareable graphical flowcharts. You can create your own,
  or start with ones created by experts in a particular domain, tweaking
  them to fit your problem.
* A home for tools: SEAMM makes it straightforward for
  developers and other experts to publish their existing and new codes
  and scripts as plug-ins and flowcharts, making them immediately
  available to the entire community.

SEAMM already has plug-ins for LAMMPS and MOPAC, with other quantum
chemistry and forcefield-based MD and Monte Carlo codes coming
soon. Other plug-ins use OpenBabel , RDKit and Packmol for reading in
structures, building fluid boxes, cheminformatic functionality,
etc. The SEAMM environment also provides integrated job management for
running your calculations, and a job database for storing them,
helping you manage the many projects and large numbers of calculations
you do each year.


SEAMM is a computational environment for creating and running
simulations of molecular, crystalline, amorphous or fluid systems
that are described at the level of atoms. While SEAMM provides the
overall environment, plugins provide specific functionality. While
some plugins handle their task internally, many are wrappers about
well-known, widely used simulation tools such as:

* MOPAC for semiempirical quantum chemistry
* GAMESS, NWChem and Psi4 for quantum cehmistry
* VASP, Quantum Espresso, FHI*aims and NWChem for periodic DFT
* GROMACS, NAMD, etc. for biomolecular molecular dynamics (MD)
* LAMMPS for molecular dynamics (MD) for materials
* Cassandra and Towhee for Monte Carlo simulations of fluids

Other plugins provide functionality for building structures,
e.g. Packmol, for converting file formats using Open Babel, and
cheminformatics functionality in RDKit.

Of course, at the moment SEAMM is just getting started and only has
functionality from MOPAC, LAMMPS, Open Babel, Packmol and RDKit, but
is built to cover the wide range of molecular and material modeling
illustrated by the codes above.

How do you run a simulation?
############################
You create a flowchart, like this:

.. image:: _images/flowchart.png
	    :width: 906px
	    :height: 731px
	    :align: center
	    :alt: An example flowchart

that defines the steps you want in your simulation. Once you are
satisfied with it, there are a number ways to run it ... but we are
getting ahead of ourselves!

See the menu for the details about installing SEAMM, making
flowcharts, and running.
