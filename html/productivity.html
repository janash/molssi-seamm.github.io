<p>SEAMM helps you get your work done faster and more easilty. First, it
helps you set up your calculations. The large simulation codes are
wrapped in plug-ins which provide intuitive graphical user interfaces
(GUIs) so you don’t have to start with an empty input file in a text
editor and remeber all the keywords and commands for each code. While
you maybe very comfortable with one or two codes, you probably can use
other codes in your research, but don’t know their input as
well. SEAMM supports a wide range of codes, such as</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>MOPAC for semiempirical quantum chemistry</p></li>
<li><p>GAMESS, NWChem and Psi4 for quantum cehmistry</p></li>
<li><p>VASP, Quantum Espresso, FHI-aims and NWChem for periodic DFT</p></li>
<li><p>GROMACS, NAMD, etc. for biomolecular molecular dynamics (MD)</p></li>
<li><p>LAMMPS for molecular dynamics (MD) for materials</p></li>
<li><p>Cassandra and Towhee for Monte Carlo simulations of fluids</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other plugins provide functionality for building structures,
e.g. Packmol, for converting file formats using Open Babel, and
cheminformatics functionality with RDKit. The ‘helpers’ do the little
tasks that you need to wrangle structures into the simulation codes
and analyze results, things you either had to do yourself or had to
find scripts and codes that did what you needed.</p>
<p>Between the GUI’s and the convenient ‘helper’ plugins setting up your
workflow will indeed be faster and less error prone. Two other aspects
of SEAMM will help you do even more. First, SEAMM has loops and other
control structures built in, so when you want to run over several
molecules, or do a parameter sweep, you can easily automate the
workflow. Results can be captured in tables and output for
e.g. analysis in a spreadsheet program.</p>
<p>The last aspect is that the flowcharts that you, and others, develop
in SEAMM can be saved, rerun and shared. You probably already do this
with scripts that you write, but creating flowcharts in SEAMM is
easier than writing scripts – and they will run in any other copy of
SEAMM. So you can build up a library of flowcharts for common tasks
and share them in your group. Or email them to a colleague. This means
that if you need to some calculations that you are not completely
expert at, you can get a flowchart written by an expert to use as-is
or tweak it to do precisely what you need.</p>
<p>These features help you get more done more quickly. It also helps you
make fewer mistakes and waste less time tracking them down. But now
that you can do more, SEAMM helps you in other ways. The integrated
job management helps you control the jobs that you are running, and
the job database captures every job that you run. When it comes time
to write the paper or project report, everything is there at your
fingertips.</p>
